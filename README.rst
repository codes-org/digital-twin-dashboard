Right now this takes in a dataset generated by the `ROSS Instrumentation layer<https://ross-org.github.io/documentation.html#instrumentation>`_.
There is a small sample dataset located in this repo at ``tests/data/ross-binary-data/ross-stats-gvt.bin``. 
It was generated using the PHOLD model, which is pretty load balanced, so it's not particularly interesting.
More interesting sample data will be uploaded in the future.
